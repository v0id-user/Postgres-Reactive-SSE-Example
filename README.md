# üìÆ PostgreSQL Reactive Newsletter

A real-time newsletter application showcasing PostgreSQL's NOTIFY/LISTEN feature for reactive updates, inspired by modern databases like Convex.

## üí° The Idea

While exploring Convex DB's real-time features, I wondered: "Could we achieve something similar with good old PostgreSQL?" Turns out, we can! This project demonstrates how to build reactive features using PostgreSQL's NOTIFY/LISTEN mechanism, paired with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for efficient real-time updates.

Why SSE instead of WebSocket? Sometimes simpler is better! SSE provides a lightweight, one-way communication channel that's perfect for real-time updates, with built-in reconnection handling and better HTTP integration.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Updates**: PostgreSQL NOTIFY/LISTEN + SSE for instant data synchronization
- **Modern Stack**: FastAPI for async operations, PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- **Efficient Communication**: Server-Sent Events for lightweight real-time updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up!

This example project got a pretty big refactor with a lot of help from AI. I've broke everything up into smaller, modular pieces to make things easier to manage and read. The core functionality is still the same. So If something does not work, just check out the first commit to see how it was before or hit me up if you need help!

## Try It Yourself

1. **Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   - Python 3.7+
   - PostgreSQL 9.5+
   # OR
   - Docker
   ```

2. **Quick Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Local Setup
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Set up your database
   CREATE DATABASE dum_db;
   CREATE TABLE newsletters (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title TEXT NOT NULL,
       content TEXT NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   # Option 2: Docker Setup
   docker compose up
   ```

3. **Run It**:
   ```bash
   # For local setup
   python main.py

   # For Docker
   # Already running if you used docker compose up
   
   # Visit http://localhost:8000 to see it in action!
   ```

## How It Works

1. **The Flow**:
   - PostgreSQL notifies on data changes
   - FastAPI listens and forwards updates
   - SSE delivers updates to the browser
   - UI updates instantly

2. **The Stack**:
   - FastAPI for modern async Python
   - PostgreSQL's built-in pub/sub
   - Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

I've written a detailed blog post explaining how PostgreSQL's NOTIFY/LISTEN mechanism works with Server-Sent Events to create a reactive system. The post covers the abstract concepts of the implementation details, and the reasoning behind some technical decisions, focusing on the backend:

üìù ~~[How to make PostgreSQL Reactive with Server-sent Events(SSE)? (Backend)](https://blog.v0id.me/how-to-make-postgresql-reactive/)~~ The write got removed from ghost.org do to an issue with payment fees. Working on restoring it soon.

## üéØ Key Takeaway

You don't always need specialized real-time databases or complex WebSocket setups. Sometimes, combining traditional tools in creative ways (PostgreSQL + SSE) can give you similar capabilities with less complexity.
